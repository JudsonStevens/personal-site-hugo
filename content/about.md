## Currently

I'm currently a Lead Software Engineer with [Reboot Motion][13], a company providing bio-kinematic and motion analsysis as a service, primarily to Major League Baseball teams.
Previously I was a Tech Team Manager with [Fast Enterprises][8], working on a combination of DevOps, infrastructure, and traditional software development in VB.Net and C#.
I also enjoy coding in my off time, where I run a consulting company working in Ruby on Rails and React.
I've built out several projects for some mid sized organizations including [the Johns Hopkins Hospital][9] and the [Univerisity of Alabama at Birmingham's School of Medicine][10].
I also really enjoy working with students and alumni from Turing along with veterans and military spouses from [Operation Code][11]; I've provided mentorship, job search coaching, and interview practice for over many folks from these two organizations and others.
I also currently act as the CTO of the [National Alliance for Sickle Cell Centers][12], providing software development services and advice on their technical infrastructure.

## Turing

I started at the [Turing School of Software and Design][4] in March of 2018, attending their in person 7 month program for back-end engineering.
Turing teaches students using Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, and some Javascript.
I attended their program because it was the longest one that I had found and they accepted the GI Bill. I also took into account their [Course Report][5] record.
I believe Course Report does a better job that most vetting and verifying their data.
I agree with the reviews on the site - the curriculum is fairly lengthy and the amount of information can be overwhelming at times.
Looking back on the program, there are aspects I would change and some I would keep - the ones I would keep more than outwiegh what I would change.

One aspect of Turing that I was extremely happy for was the time that we spent learning about [diversity and inclusion][6] in the tech industry, and what we could potentially do about it.
This was not something I had thought very often about during my time in the military and various blue collar jobs I had held since; also, the lessons at Turing were the opposite of heavy handed.
Turing really encouraged you to think about the different aspects of the struggle of [BIPOC][7] and other minority members of the tech community and elsewhere.
I sincerely believe this has made me a better person.

From a technical sense, I believe Turing does a good job of preparing someone to hit the ground running working for a company to build software.
There are of course gaps in the foundation - it's impossible to cover all the foundational topics and ideas in software in 7 months - but the foundation they do provide is extremely stable.
I was able to interview and find a job while still attending Turing and left before Mod 4 (Turing is split into 4 six week "modules") in order to take that job.

## Before Software

I obtained a degree in [Nanosystems Engineering][1] from Louisiana Tech University; while in school, I joined the United States Marine Corps Reserves, where I deployed twice.
One deployment was a combat deployment to [Helmand Province, Afghanistan][2], near the city of Marjah.
The second was a training mission to [Rustavi, Georgia][3] (the Republic) in 2013, where we trained a battalion of their soldiers in tactics and strategies to use on their deployment to Afghanistan.
After that, I worked in the bar industry (up to and including owning a bar), ran a small construction company working with FEMA in 2016 and then remodeling homes in Texas and LA, and helping my father run his catering business.
